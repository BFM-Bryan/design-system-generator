# Design System Generator (DSG)

Design System Generator (DSG) is a boilerplate for creating a custom style guide for your organization's design system. It provides just enough IA and hooks to get any project started.

## How it works
Design System Generator (DSG) is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which works quite well for managing the content of a style guide.

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone the files from the [repository on Bitbucket](https://#).
2. In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run the `jekyll serve` command. This will build the static site and watch for changes.
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser to see the design system live in a browser.

From here, obviously the point is to customize the the Design System for project needs and populate it with content and components.
